### ABOUT H2020 EMB3RS PROJECT

This project takes place in collaboration with researchers and industry partners from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Portugal and the United Kingdom. It is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme (Grant Agreement N°847121).

16 companies and institutes from across Europe have joined forces as part of the EU-funded project EMB3Rs to add value to waste heat and help make better use of renewable energy sources. A novel tool will be developed which will allow the users to connect excess heat and cold sources and sinks and to explore ways of reusing their excess thermal energy. Users such as industries and energy communities will be able to determine the costs and benefits of industrial excess heat and cold utilisation.
